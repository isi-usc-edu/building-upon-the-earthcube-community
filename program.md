* Working sessions  

**Timeline:**

April 21: Abstract due

### Posters and Oral Presentations

As with many scientific meetings and conferences, these presentations will be the key communication platform.  The date/time of your presentation will be communicated to presenters upon acceptance. *Please note: there will be a limited number of oral presentations.*

We are solicitating contributions focused on the following subjects:  

* Science/tools enabled by geoinformatics projects  

* Broader outcomes that have used tools developed through a geoinformatics project (notebooks, workshops, courses)  

* Social and DEI impacts of geoinformatics projects, from accessibility to equity  

* Results from Research Coordination Networks

### Demonstrations

We welcome demonstrations (including Jupyter Notebooks) that would be of broad interest to the community. Participants will be expected demo their tools at the workshop. For submission, a link to a website or a fully executable notebook in [myBinder](https://mybinder.org) is requested. 

### Working Sessions

We welcome submissions for working sessions. Working sessions may consist of mini hack-a-thons, do-a-thons, work-a-thons, or other kinds of sessions in which the community is engaged to discuss particular questions, provide feedback on new technologies, or evaluate new frameworks for data policies, procedures, or workflows. The goal of working sessions are to move the community forward on particular topics of interest to the community.

To propose a working session please indicate:  

* Session Title  

* Session Leaders  

* Session Overview  

* Key Session Activities  

* Key Session Outcome/Product  

* How will the outcomes be shared?  

* Required materials or technology  

* How will the organizers involve early-career participants in their session?  

* How will the organizers involve members of an underrepresented group in the geo/computer sciences in their session?
