    title: Building Upon the EarthCube Community
    text: >+
      We welcome those interested in the intersection between cyberinfrastructure and geosciences to join us in Marina Del Rey, CA on June 27-28 2023.  
        
      For nearly a decade, the EarthCube community has been transforming the conduct of geosciences research by developing and maintaining a well-connected and facile environment that improves access, sharing, visualization, and analysis of data and related resources to foster a better understanding of our complex and changing planet. This workshop builds on previous Annual Meetings, allowing the community to catalyze around new opportunities at the frontier of geosciences and cyberinfrastructure.   
        
      The heart of EarthCube is its people and we will keep this tradition. We would like to extend a warm welcome to early-career scientists starting their career at the intersection of these exciting fields. Whether you have been engaged in EarthCube or not, we welcome contributions from everyone who shares our interests and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community. [Community Participation Guidelines](#codeofconduct).  
        
      __Meeting Objectives:__

      * Share novel approaches and architectures used in geoscience research

      * Foster learning and collaboration

      * Learn about opportunities and sustainability plans for the geoinformatics community

      * Promote topics that enhance the Earth Sciences

      * Updates on EarthCube funded projects

      * And of course, networking!
