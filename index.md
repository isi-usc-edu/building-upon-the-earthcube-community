    text: >-
    We welcome those interested in the intersecton between cyberinfrastructure and geoscieces to join us in Marina Del Rey, CA on June 27-28 22023. 

    For nearly a decade, the EarthCube community has been transforming the conduct of geosciences research by developing and maintaining a well-connected and facile environment that improves access, sharing, visualization, and analysis of data and related resources to foster a better understanding of our complex and changing planet. This workshop builds on previous Annual Meetings, allowing the community to catalize around new opportunities at the frontier of geosciences and cyberinfrastructure. 

    The heart of EarthCube is its people and we will keep this tradition. We would like to extend a warm welcome to early-career scientists starting their career at the intersection of these exciting fields. Whether you have been engaged in EarthCube or not, we welcome contributions from everyone who shares our interests and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community.
