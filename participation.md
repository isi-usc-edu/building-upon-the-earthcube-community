    We welcome contributions from everyone who shares our interests and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community.
      
    In order to help us create a safe and positive community experience we have adopted these Community Participation Guidelines, and we require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these guidelines. The Community Participation Guidelines describe expected behaviors and responsibilities for an individual, group, or organization when involved with the Building Upon the EarthCube Community Workshop.
      
    These guidelines aim to support a community where all people feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas, and inspire others, regardless of:  

    * Background

    * Family status

    * Marital status

    * Gender

    * Gender identity or expression

    * Sex

    * Sexual orientation

    * Native language

    * Age

    * Ability 

    * Race and/or ethnicity

    * Caste and/or social hierarchy

    * National origin, including immigration status

    * Socioeconomic status

    * Religion

    * Geographic location

    * Educational background, discipline, or specialization

    * Any other dimension of diversity  
    
    Openness, collaboration, and participation are core aspects of our work. Diversity enriches our community, and we actively seek participation from those who increase it. These guidelines exist to further empower individuals and groups to interact and collaborate for mutual benefit.

  title: Section 1 - When to Use These Guidelines
  text: >+
    These guidelines outline our behavior expectations in all workshop activities, both offline and online. Your continued participation is contingent upon following these guidelines. These activities include but are not limited to:  
    
    * Working with participants and ISI staff members virtually or co-located.

    * Participating in workshop-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, Slack channels, GitHub issues, group or person-to-person meetings, and correspondence.    
​
    While these guidelines are specifically aimed at EarthCube’s work and community, we recognize that actions taken outside of EarthCube’s online or in-person spaces could impact community health. For example, actions taken outside of EarthCube’s spaces by an EarthCube community member against another EarthCube community member may warrant corrective measures as detailed later in the [Section 4](#consequences) of this document.

  title: Expected Behavior
  text: >+
    This workshop provides opportunities to acquire and exchange knowledge across communities. We each share the responsibility to serve as models for meeting behavioral expectations.      
    
    The following behaviors are expected of all participants.  These are the broad standards we hold ourselves to within the community.  Specific behaviors that the organizing committee is capable of directly responding to are detailed in [Section 3](#nottolerated).   
    
    Unacceptable behavior should be reported (see [Section 5](#reporting)) as this assists in correcting and addressing unwelcome behavior, and can help establish a pattern of unacceptable behaviors or an unwelcoming community culture.     
​
    ## Be Respectful  

    Value each other’s ideas, styles, and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities, different viewpoints and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may affect people. Be direct, constructive, and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.  
​
    ## Be Clear, Professional, and Considerate  
    
    We are likely to have some discussions about criticisms that are respectful and those that are not. We must be able to speak clearly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and clear, as well as respectful and considerate.    
​
    ## Be Inclusive  

    Recognize that certain voices have been excluded from conversations, and that inclusion is an important component of equity, therefore actively seek diverse perspectives. Diverse views on teams power innovation, even if diversity is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.    

    ## Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:

    * Not native language speakers

    * Coming from a different culture

    * Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”

    * Facing other challenges to participate

    Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Be an advocate for others’ voices. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them. For example, consider venue and inclusiveness. Setting informal meetings in bars or meeting for ‘Happy Hour’ may not be a safe setting for all members of the community. Consider other models, such as a meal or utilizing a professional meeting setting. Standing receptions (including poster sessions) with belly bars or high top tables or no seating only are not inclusive nor accessible to people who are differently abled.
​
    ## Understand Different Perspectives  
    
    Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument.  A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.
​
    ## Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences  

    The workshop participants come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences encompass everything from official religious observances, to personal habits, to clothing and more. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory practices, and act as an advocate for others. Think of others’ needs from their points of view. Appreciate that tone of voice and conflict responses may differ across cultural backgrounds. Use preferred titles (including pronouns). Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to their cultural background,  personal beliefs, and social expression. It is unrealistic to expect participants to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but participants are expected to be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating themselves. 
​
    ## Lead by Example  
    
    By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors.
