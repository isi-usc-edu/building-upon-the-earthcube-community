    We welcome contributions from everyone who shares our interests and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community.
      
    In order to help us create a safe and positive community experience we have adopted these Community Participation Guidelines, and we require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these guidelines. The Community Participation Guidelines describe expected behaviors and responsibilities for an individual, group, or organization when involved with the Building Upon the EarthCube Community Workshop.
      
    These guidelines aim to support a community where all people feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas, and inspire others, regardless of:  

    * Background

    * Family status

    * Marital status

    * Gender

    * Gender identity or expression

    * Sex

    * Sexual orientation

    * Native language

    * Age

    * Ability 

    * Race and/or ethnicity

    * Caste and/or social hierarchy

    * National origin, including immigration status

    * Socioeconomic status

    * Religion

    * Geographic location

    * Educational background, discipline, or specialization

    * Any other dimension of diversity  
    
    Openness, collaboration, and participation are core aspects of our work. Diversity enriches our community, and we actively seek participation from those who increase it. These guidelines exist to further empower individuals and groups to interact and collaborate for mutual benefit.
