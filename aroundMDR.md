Public transportation in Marina Del Rey is through Metro, the Culver City Green Bus Line, and the Santa Monica Big Blue Bus. There also more local options such as a waterbus that can get you from one side of the Marina to the other in a fun way. For more information, see [this website](https://visitmdr.com/plan-your-visit/transportation). If you decide to stay in another location than MDR for the meeting, remember the Los Angeles saying: "It will take 45 minutes!" This is true, even for a 4-mi drive. 

## <a name='meals'> Meals </a>

We will not be providing meals during the workshop (on the bright side, your registration is free). There are many options to eat near ISI, including two shopping malls with several lunch options within a 5min walk from the building. The area across Mindanao has a Ralphs along with other dining options such Chipotle, Mendocino Farms (sandwich and salads), California Pizza Kitchen, a burger place. The other mall on the other side of Lincoln (Marina Square Shopping Mall) also contains dining options. There is a Trader Joe’s across the street from the building.
